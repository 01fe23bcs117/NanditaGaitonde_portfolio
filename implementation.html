        <p class="section-title">i) Tourism</p>
        <p class="subcases-title">Sub cases:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>1. Mapping tourist places with area codes:</b></li>
            <p>- For someone who's been visiting the city for the first time, it would be difficult to navigate through the city, for which <span class="highlight">arrays</span> could be used.</p>
            <p>- Array would help store the area code of various tourist places that the city offers to be visited. This way it would be easy for a person to search places and even communicate with the locals.</p>

            <li><b>2. Planning the itinerary:</b></li>
            <p>- The first step for visitors would be to decide in what order they would like to explore the city, for which <span class="highlight">lists</span> could be used.</p>
            <p>- It manages the sequence of destination and the time required to travel from one to other sequentially.</p>

            <li><b>3. Recommending top stays:</b></li>
            <p>- Once the itinerary is done, the next step would be to search for a well-suited stay, for which <span class="highlight">heap sort</span> would be used to prioritize and recommend the top-rated stays or restaurants for tourists.</p>
            <p>- This would be accomplished using <span class="highlight">structure</span> where all the related details of each stay/hotel would be stored for easy access (e.g., Name, area, price per night, rating, contact).</p>
            <p>- Max heap would be constructed with the highest-rated hotel at the root and based on the ratings it would extract the top-rated stays.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Parental dominance, Balancing a Tree, Transform and conquer</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: O(nlogn)</p>

            <li><b>4. Discovering popular landmarks:</b></li>
            <p>- <span class="highlight">Trie</span> would be used to autocomplete the search of popular destinations, which would be helpful for non-local residents. For example, by searching 'palac', it completes and shows 'chitra palace' (hypothetical).</p>
            <p>- In addition to this, <span class="highlight">Boyer-Moore algorithm</span> would help confirm the existence of the place searched because it works faster for predictable text, such as popular landmarks within the city with longer and complicated names.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Pattern Recognition, Prefix and Suffix, Space and Time Tradeoff</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: O(n⋅m) where: n = Length of the text, m = Length of the pattern.</p>

            <li><b>5. Managing ticket queues:</b></li>
            <p>- At historic landmarks like palaces, forts, museums with dense populations, <span class="highlight">queues</span> would be used to ensure the smooth ticket generation process, following FIFO (First In First Out).</p>
            <p>- In addition to this, <span class="highlight">Hashing</span> would be used to store the tourist details before entering the site to maintain records of their visit.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Space and Time Tradeoff.</p>

            <li><b>6. Optimizing travel:</b></li>
            <p>- Optimizing travel would be based on one's preference.</p>
            <p>- In order to find the cost-effective path with minimum cost for traveling from one heritage site to another, <span class="highlight">Kruskal algorithm</span> along with <span class="highlight">Union Find</span> would be used as it does not generate cycles.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Greedy technique, Minimum Spanning tree algorithm</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: |E|log|E|</p>

            <p>- In order to find the time-effective path such as the shortest path, <span class="highlight">Dijkstra</span> would be used as it works well with positive cycles.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Greedy technique, Edge Relaxation, Single source shortest path</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: Θ(|V|^2) for graphs represented by their weight matrix and the priority queue implemented by an unordered array and O(|E| log|V|) for graphs represented by their adjacency lists and the priority queue implemented as a min-heap.</p>

            <p>- In order to narrow down the traveling by knowing which two places take less cost, time, and distance to travel, <span class="highlight">Floyd</span> would be used in cases where tourists wish to travel only a few nearby places.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Dynamic Programming, Kleene Closure, All-pairs shortest path</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: cubic</p>

            <li><b>7. Identifying peak tourist months:</b></li>
            <p>- To keep track of the maximum revenue generated from each month, a <span class="highlight">sparse table</span> would be used for statistical planning.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Dynamic Programming, Pre-Computing.</p>

    <!-- Energy Generation and Supply Section -->
    <div class="section-box">
        <p class="section-title">ii) Energy Generation and Supply</p>
        <p class="subcases-title">Sub cases:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>1. Storing monthly energy output:</b></li>
            <p>- To keep track of the total energy generated by the solar or wind power source, <span class="highlight">arrays</span> would be used as it is homogeneous data.</p>

            <li><b>2. Tracking cumulative energy distribution over time:</b></li>
            <p>- To keep track of total energy distributed to various areas over a period of time by cumulatively adding new supplied energy to previous ones, <span class="highlight">Fenwick trees</span> would be used for this purpose. It can also query how much energy a set of customers or a group of sectors consumed in the last month.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Dynamic programming, Pre-computing</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: O(log n)</p>

            <li><b>3. Determining connectivity by shared energy line:</b></li>
            <p>- In order to know which group of areas or a particular region receives energy from the same source, <span class="highlight">union-find</span> would play a role.</p>
            <p>- It could help the concerned distributing sector to improve the lines or connect the regions to any newly built line or source.</p>

            <li><b>4. Deciding on energy generation and distribution in the city:</b></li>
            <p>- To handle large datasets of various wind and solar plants present in the city and the energy it generates, efficient sorting is required. For this, <span class="highlight">Quick sort</span> would be used to sort the energy data so that distributors know which plants are generating more power and whether optimization is needed.</p>
            <p>- Similarly, it would determine which areas consume more energy to install more pipelines and which consume less in order to merge nearby pipelines.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Divide and Conquer</p>

            <li><b>5. Searching for house registered:</b></li>
            <p>- During conflicts among customers and the agency, the agency would use <span class="highlight">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</span> to search whether the customer has registered for the supply agency and whether they are eligible to receive the supply.</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Pattern Matching</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: O(n + m) where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the pattern</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>1. Mapping roads:</b></li>
            <p>- A simple road map can be represented by <span class="highlight">adjacency lists</span> to show which roads are connected. It will store all available routes from one location to another.</p>

            <li><b>2. Managing traffic:</b></li>
            <p>- To handle the traffic data at different points, we use <span class="highlight">heaps</span> to manage the priority of routes and avoid traffic jams during peak hours.</p>

            <li><b>3. Route optimization for public transport:</b></li>
            <p>- For public transportation planning, we need to identify the shortest routes available. The <span class="highlight">Dijkstra algorithm</span> will help in calculating the shortest possible route between various transport points (bus stops, metro stations).</p>
            <p class="design-technique">Design technique: Greedy algorithm, Single source shortest path</p>
            <p class="efficiency">Efficiency: O(|V|^2)</p>

            <li><b>4. Traffic prediction during peak hours:</b></li>
            <p>- <span class="highlight">Machine learning algorithms</span> can predict road traffic based on historical data. This would allow the city to plan accordingly and manage resources effectively during peak hours.</p>

            <li><b>5. Dynamic toll management:</b></li>
            <p>- A dynamic toll system can optimize traffic flow by adjusting toll rates based on traffic congestion using <span class="highlight">HashMaps</span> for fast lookups and updates of toll rates based on real-time data.</p>
