        <h1>Energy generation and supply ‚ö°</h1>
        <p>
            City with 1500 sq.km area indeed would harbour a lot of households atleast in the near future, which woud lead to high energy consumption, mainly electricity. Fot this, there is wind power and solar power plants set up. Along with this, it needs to be properly distributed to every household efficiently for which efficient pipelines would be required, which this business case aims to solve.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header-box">
        <h1>Road transport üõ£</h1>
        <p>
            Such a huge city which has area greater than the city of Delhi,India(1484 sq.km) would have people commuting to different corners via roads and would require efficient roads well connected within the city and also connecting the neighbouring areas. This business case aims to reduce redundancy of path and aims to provide adequate , good quality transport. It also aims to isolate the highways so that it would not intefere with the busy city.
