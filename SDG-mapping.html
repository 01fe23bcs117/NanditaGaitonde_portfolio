        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p><span class="highlight">SDG Target 11.4:</span> Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the worldâ€™s cultural and natural heritage.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">SDG Indicator 11.4.1:</span> Share of municipal budget which is dedicated to the preservation, protection, and conservation of state/national cultural natural heritage, including World Heritage sites.</p>
        <p>The SDG promotes tourism in showcasing local products and culture. It could also promote job opportunities and directly impact revenue generation, which is what this business case is aiming for.</p>
        <p>This would require us to find the quickest/shortest path that would join every tourist site and also make the path quicker connecting each site. Kruskal would be a good option to find the shortest path connecting every site.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p><span class="highlight">SDG Target 11.6:</span> By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">SDG Indicator 11.6.2:</span> Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted).</p>
        <p>The following points explain the current issues and the SDG goal related to energy generation and supply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Of 759 million people, 1 out of 10 do not have access to electricity and have to use biomass fuels such as charcoal, coal, which is leading to the death of children due to indoor pollution.</li>
            <li>The SDG goal-11 aims to replace the open fires and outdated stoves with affordable and clean energy by 2030.</li>
            <li>Energy efficiency and increased use of renewable sources contribute to reducing the seriousness of climate change and reducing the risk of disasters.</li>
            <li>We need to sort based on which areas need to be supplied with energy and which are barren land for now. For that, a sorting algorithm needs to be implemented.</li>

        <p><span class="highlight">SDG Target 11.2:</span> By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">SDG Indicator 11.2.1:</span> Proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport, disaggregated by age group, sex, and persons with disabilities.</p>
        <p>The SDG aims to connect all the major places and provide safety in transport, inclusive of physically challenged and elderly people.</p>
        <p>This comes in accordance with efficient land use planning, in the sense of how much area is used for roads and its connectivity. It mainly concentrates on residential and employment-generative areas.</p>
